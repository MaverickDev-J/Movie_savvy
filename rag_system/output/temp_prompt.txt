we are more aware of what , contrary to what the general populace would believe is a very real 21st century problem.on rating the film which is the sole purpose of the review, i will give it 8 for its rushed conclusion.
after reading the other glowing reviews on imdb, there is little to no doubt that the other reviewers are either paid for their reviews or are somehow affiliated with this movie. it is terrible!. next to no plot, it comes across as something that was thrown together in a few hours and the screenplay in less time, the acting goes from flat to down right annoying, not even the kids found the jokes mildly amusing. this is as flat and forgettable as it comes, even the animation comes across as cheap. save your and avoid this mess.i can see how anyone could find anything redeeming at all about it, pure garbage! it is apparently based on a book, i wont be looking it up to see if a injustice to the source material has been done, i have never been compelled to write a review before, but if i can save someone from sitting through this garbage, then mission accomplished.
dont go for critics review. it is one of the well made movie. must watch
there is no review, as i didnt deem this a film. its like a fever dream...without the fever.non-sensical from start to finish.top 3 worst things ive watched in my life!
