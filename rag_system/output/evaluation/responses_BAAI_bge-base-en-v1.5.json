Rajamouli, produced by Shobu Yarlagadda and Prasad Devineni on an estimated budget of â‚¹2.5 billion (US$32 million). It is the second installment in the Baahubali film series, following Baahubali: The Beginning (2015) and preceding Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017). The film stars Prabhas, Rana Daggubati, Tamannaah, Anushka Shetty, Ramya Krishnan and Sathyaraj. It is the story of Amarendra Baahubali (Prabhas), the heir to the throne of Mahishmati, who goes on a journey to find out the truth about his origins.\n\nAfter the events of the first film, Amarendra Baahubali (Prabhas) is crowned king of Mahishmati. He learns from his guru, Kattappa (Sathyaraj), that the empire's enemies are planning to invade and seeks to unite the warring tribes. He rides out with his army and faces the enemy king, Bhisma (Nassar). During the battle, Baahubali falls in love with Devasena (Anushka Shetty), Bhisma's daughter, who is captured by his men. Baahubali rescues her from the enemy's fortress and returns to Mahishmati with her.\n\nOn the way back, Baahubali takes a detour through a village where two friends, Shivudu (Prabhas) and his father-in-law, both of whom are deaf and mute, live. Shivudu is a shepherd who has been in love with a girl named Avanthika (Tamannaah) since childhood. Avanthika is a warrior who has been trained by her father to fight for justice. She joins a group of rebels led by a man named Kattappa (Rana Daggubati) to fight against the tyrannical king of Mahishmati, Bhallaladeva (Rana Daggubati).\n\nShivudu and his father-in-law are attacked by a group of men who are loyal to the king. Shivudu is captured and taken to the palace where he is forced to fight in the arena for the entertainment of the king. He manages to escape and returns to his village where he finds out that his father-in-law is dead. He decides to avenge his death by taking on the king himself.\n\nHe learns that Avanthika is also in love with Shivudu and wants to marry him. They both decide to go to Mahishmati together and fight against the tyrant king. When they reach Mahishmati, they find out that Avanthika has been captured by the king and is being forced to marry him. They rescue her from the palace and fight against the king's army.\n\nDuring the battle, Avanthika is fatally wounded and Shivudu is left to fight the king alone. He manages to defeat the king and avenge his father-in-law's death. After the battle, he finds out that Avanthika has died and he is heartbroken.

  "what do the reviews say about the anime steins gate": "- Overall Score: 8/10\n- Reason: The ending has a little English sung (opening does too but around the end) and both songs fits the plot of the anime overall.\n- Character: 7-\n- Reason: They added a lot of characters in a short amount of time. And because the anime deals with delusions and false things, what you see in a character may change or not be real at all. There was no extensive background for all the characters- just bits and pieces, but only enough to progress the story and why the characters need to fight. The most detailed of the characters wold possibly be the main one since his comes out of the blue (won't reveal more than that). The villains within the anime do a heck of a good job masking themselves until later- but if one can put the pieces together then it is fairly simple. Oh and look out for a guy that looks like a homeless person.\n- Enjoyment: I enjoyed it fully which is why I gave it an 8. Yes the only reason it didn't get a 10 was because of the confusion it causes at the beginning and the way all the characters come together. Not saying it's a full on rush just to get them all in, but they were delightful with their own personalities and had meanings. They added some Mythology into it as well which I thought was a good touch since it connected with the plot as well. You'll enjoy the ending, you may even cry.\n- Overall-8: Reason- the characters-good enough to be their own and progress the story. Artwork and sound- decent to great depending on the scenes, and what was going on. Story and plot over all-confusing, mysterious, but a well-defined one that would give any mystery goer a run for their money. My suggestion is if you watch this series, go and watch it first- then watch Steins;Gate. It has a connection to it.",
